# Welcome to SAZN!
SAZN are the initials of our team members, an organization made for the purpose of collaborating on projects as part of the ArkX Talent Factory bootcamp. A four month bootcamp focused on acquiring essential web development skills using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js) Stack. 

We are currently working on a [CRM system](https://github.com/spytech-arkx/mern-crm) built with the MERN, you are welcome to contribute or simply give us feedback!
